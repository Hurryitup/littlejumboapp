# TODO
- [ ] Icons: The star and balloon icons need to be added to a custom icon font. I recomend iconmoon.io.

- [ ] Current Location: It works in the browser but the native app is having issues. 

- [ ] Date Chooser: We don't want it to take up the whole screen. The height can be set by overriding the SCSS defaults for modals but right now this breaks the animations.

- [ ] Date Chooser List: List should be improved with the date ranges, and an indication of which is selected.

- [ ] 64 Bit: If we don't configure ionic to output a 64bit based app, ios devices will complain that "This app may slow down your device."

- [ ] http://pastebin.com/KRK6gqtq, http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/, http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/app/data/data-medford.json?callback=cb  â€” enough said.

- [ ] Persistance: We need to allow people to remember favorites and such between sessions. I belive ionic has an easy way to do this.
