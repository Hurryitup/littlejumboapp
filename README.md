# The Little Jumbo App

## What is it?
Ever seen a confused prospie walking around campus? Exactly.
This app has been built to help prospective students find their way around the Admissions department's on-campus events. With the schedule of a day's events and their locations available through the app, we hope our little jumbos can always find their herd.

## The Specs
We built this app using the ionic framework, which allows us to build for android and iOS at the same time by using angular to create the front-end. The back end (in a different repository), is built on NodeJS with a MongoDB database, with data validation being done using Mongoose.

## Release information
This app has not yet been released to the public, but will be by April 1st, right in time for our Regular Decision results.
